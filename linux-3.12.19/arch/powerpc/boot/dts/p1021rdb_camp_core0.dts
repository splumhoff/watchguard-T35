 * In CAMP mode, each core needs to have its own dts. Only mpic and L2 cache
 * can be shared, all the other devices must be assigned to one core only.
 * This dts file allows core0 to have memory, l2, serail0, i2c, spi, gpio,
 * tdm, dma, usb, eth0, eth1, sdhc, crypto, global-util, message, pci0, pci1,
 * msi.
 *
 * Please note to add "-b 0" for core0's dts compiling.
