This dir holds the scripts WatchGuard kernel config files, and some utility scripts

=======
CONFIGS
=======
i386/*   : config file for all 32-bit x86 platforms

x86_64/* : config file for all 64-bit x86 platforms

powerpc/*: config file for all 32-bit powerpc platforms

powerpc_64/*: config file for all 64-bit powerpc platforms

=======
SCRIPTS
=======

oldconfig-all.sh
================
This script does the following:
a) check out every kernel.config and kdump.config
b) run "make oldconfig" for every kernel.config and kdump.config
c) copies the new .config file back to its original location.

Use this if:  You have made changes to Kconfig, like adding a new CONFIG_XXXX value.
This script will then validate it against every platform we build.

oldconfig-opened.sh
===================
Does the following:
a) for every kernel.config and kdump.config that is checked out
b) runs "make oldconfig" on every currently p4 opened kernel.config and kdump.config
c) checks that the new config isn't different from the p4 opened .config

Use this if: you have changed the kernel.config in someway.  Sometimes changing a
kernel.config will have ripple effects.  This script will catch that.

split-config.sh
===============
This script finds any arch differences in a kernel.config file.  Tracks how configs are
different, at the global, arch, and platform level.

Use this if: you have changed a vashon kernel.config and it is now different from the
spokane kernel.config

audit-config.sh
===============
Runs split-config.sh to audit kernel.config file changes.  Tracks what config files
are different at what level (global, arch, platform) and emails a watchlist if the
there are more differences than the last time the audit ran.
