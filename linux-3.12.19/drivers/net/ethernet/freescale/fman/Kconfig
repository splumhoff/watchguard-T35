config FSL_FM_MAX_FRAME_SIZE

	default "1522"
	help
		Configure this in relation to the maximum possible MTU of your
		network configuration. In particular, one would need to
		increase this value in order to use jumbo frames.
		FSL_FM_MAX_FRAME_SIZE must accommodate the Ethernet FCS (4 bytes)
		and one ETH+VLAN header (18 bytes), to a total of 22 bytes in
		excess of the desired L3 MTU.

		Note that having too large a FSL_FM_MAX_FRAME_SIZE (much larger
		than the actual MTU) may lead to buffer exhaustion, especially
		in the case of badly fragmented datagrams on the Rx path.
		Conversely, having a FSL_FM_MAX_FRAME_SIZE smaller than the actual
		MTU will lead to frames being dropped.

		This can be overridden by specifying "fsl_fm_max_frm" in
		the kernel bootargs:
		 * in Hypervisor-based scenarios, by adding a "chosen" node
		with the "bootargs" property specifying
		"fsl_fm_max_frm=<YourValue>";
		 * in non-Hypervisor-based scenarios, via u-boot's env, by
		modifying the "bootargs" env variable.

	int "Add extra headroom at beginning of data buffers"

	range 16 384
	default "64"
	help
		Configure this to tell the Frame Manager to reserve some extra
		space at the beginning of a data buffer on the receive path,
		before Internal Context fields are copied. This is in addition
		to the private data area already reserved for driver internal
		use. The provided value must be a multiple of 16.

		This setting can be overridden by specifying
		"fsl_fm_rx_extra_headroom" in the kernel bootargs:
		 * in Hypervisor-based scenarios, by adding a "chosen" node
		with the "bootargs" property specifying
		"fsl_fm_rx_extra_headroom=<YourValue>";
		 * in non-Hypervisor-based scenarios, via u-boot's env, by
		modifying the "bootargs" env variable.
