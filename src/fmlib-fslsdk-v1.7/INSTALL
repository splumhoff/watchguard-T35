Manual installation for FM library:
   - set PATH and CROSS_COMPILE to point to the cross-toolchain on the host
   - set KERNEL_SRC to point to the root dir. for the kernel/headers (i.e.
   the Linux kernel that's contained in the SDK, not other kernel!)
   - make all: will create the binaries for all platforms
   - make archive: will create the tarball containing all fmlib binaries
   - make install-xxx will:
	* copy binary (libfm-xxx.a) to the ${PREFIX}/lib folder on the target
	root filesystem pointed to by the ${DESTDIR} variable
	* copy headers (include/fmd/ dir.) to the ${PREFIX}/include/fmd/ dir.
	on target rfs
	* copy doc. files to the ${PREFIX}/share/doc/fm-lib-<version> dir
	of the same rfs

'make targets' will display a short usage summary, along with the available
"xxx" variants.

An application that uses this package will have to link with the static
library and include the necessary headers.
